## EX : 5 IMPLEMENTATION OF RAIL FENCE CIPHER

## AIM:

To develop a simple C program to implement Rail Fence Cipher.


## ALGORITHM:
#### 1.	To perform the Encryption Process
#### •	Input the plaintext string from the user.
#### •	Calculate the length of the plaintext.
#### •	Create the ciphertext using two rails:
#### a.	First, collect characters at even indices (i.e., 0, 2, 4, …).
#### b.	Then, collect characters at odd indices (i.e., 1, 3, 5, …).
#### c.	Combine both parts to form the ciphertext.
#### •	Display the encrypted ciphertext.

#### 2.	To perform the Decryption Process:
#### •	Calculate the length of the ciphertext.
#### •	Find the midpoint:
#### ◦	a. If the length is even, midpoint = length / 2.
#### ◦	b. If the length is odd, midpoint = (length / 2) + 1.
#### •	Reconstruct the original message:
#### a.	Take the first half as characters from even positions.
#### b.	Take the second half as characters from odd positions.
#### c.	Merge both using alternating positions.

#### 3.	Display the decrypted plaintext.



## PROGRAM:

## OUTPUT:

## RESULT:
The program implementing the Rail Fence cipher for encryption and decryption has been successfully	executed,	and	the	results	have	been	verified.
